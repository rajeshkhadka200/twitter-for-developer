### Description

DevHub is a web application that allows developers to connect with each other and stay informed about ongoing hackathons. With its Twitter-inspired interface, DevHub offers features such as tweeting, retweeting, and following other users.

In addition, DevHub can collect and display popular tech blog posts from around the internet and allows developers to embed their Devits into their own websites through its API. By providing a platform for developers to connect, stay informed, and showcase their work, DevHub is a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve their coding skills and build their online presence.

<b>Why we scrap a data ?</b>

In DevHub, we use tools like Puppeteer, a Node.js library, to automate the web scraping process and make it more efficient. This helps us gather the information we need, such as popular blog posts from other platforms, to make it easier for developers to access the resources they need to stay up-to-date and grow their skills. Our goal is to provide a centralized platform for developers to find the information they need, and web scraping tools like Puppeteer are an important part of achieving that goal.
